# Ora_Interactive_Code_Challenge

Synopsis

This repo is my submission for the Ora Interactive Code Challenge.  I used Firebase for HTTP networking, though this is included in the podfile and should be all set to run as is.

As of now, some functionality described in the assignment is still missing.  For example, you cannot go into individual chats and sent new messages.  Also, I did not get a chance to convert the timestamp to “X mins ago” or add a search feature, etc.
